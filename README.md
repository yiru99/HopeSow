# HopeSow
Adam: You need to include Alamofire into your project in order to make `SwiftRequest` work. To include Alamofire, you need to go to their github and clone their project. Then drag their xcodeproj into HopeSow.

Warning: Don't use pod file to install Alamofire. It will break everything! (It will break briding header which will make swift code unable to work with objective-c code)
