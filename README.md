# HopeSow
You need to include `Alamofire` into your project in order to make `SwiftRequest` work. To include `Alamofire`, you need to go to their github (google it) and clone their project. Then drag their xcodeproj into HopeSow.

***Warning***: Don't use `pod` to install `Alamofire`. It will break everything! (It will break briding header which will make swift code unable to work with objective-c code, I learned it in a hard way :( ))
